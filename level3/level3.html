    <h1>Sheeper just learned that they did not successfully<br>
       get the position on student council. They started <br>
       to feel overwhelmed, out of control, and had <br>
       intense feelings of sadness and hopelessness. <br>
       How would you respond to help Sheeper through <br>
       his mental breakdown?
